#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine


##Objectives: 
In this lab, you create and deploy a simple App Engine application using a virtual environment in the Google Cloud Shell.

	.Initialize App Engine.

	.Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

	.Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

	.Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.
	
##Steps:
	
	You can list the active account name with this command:
		gcloud auth list
		
		- Result:Credentialed accounts: 
		- <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)
	
	You can list the project ID with this command:
	
		gcloud config list project
		
		- Result: [core]
		project = <project_ID>
		
1: Initialize App Engine

	1. Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
	
		gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
		
		- Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
	
			git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
		
		- Navigate to the source directory:
	
			cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
		
	2. Run Hello World application locally
	
		- Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.
			sudo apt-get update
			
		- Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
			
			sudo apt-get install virtualenv
			
			If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.
			
			Run this command:
				virtualenv -p python3 venv
				
		- Activate the virtual environment.
		
			source venv/bin/activate
		
		- Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
		
			pip install  -r requirements.txt
			
		Use this command to Run the application:
		
			python main.py

2. Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
	
	- In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.
	
		- Result: Hello World
		
	- To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.
	
	- Using the Cloud Console, verify that the app is not deployed.
	
		Notice that no resources are deployed.
		
3. Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

	1. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
	
		- Navigate to the source directory:
		
			cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
			
		- Deploy your Hello World application.
		
			gcloud app deploy
			
			If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
			
		- Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
		
			gcloud app browse
			
		- Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.
			
			Result: Hello World
			
4. Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.
	
	1. Disable the application

		- In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App Engine > Settings.
		
		- Click Disable application.
		
		- Read the dialog message. Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.
		
		- Refresh the browser window you used to view to the application site, you'll get a 404 error.
