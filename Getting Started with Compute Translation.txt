#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

##Objectives: 
In this Lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

	. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

	. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

	. Connect between the two instances.
	
##Steps:

1. Create a Compute Engine Virtual Machine using the Google cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
	
	gcloud cloud instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213"--subnet "default" -- tags http
	gcloud compute firewall-rule create alloww-http -- action = ALLOW --destination= INGRESS -- rules=http:80 --target-tags=htt

2.	Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command line interface.
	
	gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
	gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"

3.	Connect between the two instances.

	1.	Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
		
		- Connect to my-vm-2:
			gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
		
		- ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
			ping -c 4 my-vm-1
			
		- Use the ssh command to open command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
			ssh my-vm-1
			
		- At the command prompt my-vm-1, install Nginx web server:
			sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
			
		- Use the nano text editor to add custom message to the home page of the web server:
			sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
		
		- Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
			
			Hi from Roland Blessing 
			
		- Exit the editor and confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
		
			curl http://localhost/
		
			- Result: The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
		
		- To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
		
			exit
		
		- To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
		
			curl http://my-vm-1/
			
			- Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
			
	2.	Now get the external IP of the my-vm-1 instance from this command:
	
			gcloud compute instance list --zone us-central1-a
	
	3.	Paste the copied IP address of my-vm-1 into a new browser and hit enter
		
		- Result: You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
